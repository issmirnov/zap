Patches are welcome! Please use the standard GitHub workflow - fork this
repo and submit a PR. I'll usually get to it within a few days.

Handy commands for local development:

- `go run main.go config.go text.go web.go` to run locally
- `curl -I -L -H 'Host: g' localhost:8927/z` - to test locally e2e
- `goconvey -excludedDirs dist` - launches web UI for go tests.
- `go test` runs CLI tests.
